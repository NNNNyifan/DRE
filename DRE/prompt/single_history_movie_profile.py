    review:Blade Runner is a mind-blowing experience! That picture of the future world is so powerful, every frame is a work of art. The plot is tight and gripping, and the deep thinking on artificial intelligence and the meaning of life makes me meditate while enjoying it. "Blade Runner" music collocation is also highly emotional, like a feast for the senses. In this imaginative future world, I was not only drawn by the story, but also conquered by its unique aesthetics.
